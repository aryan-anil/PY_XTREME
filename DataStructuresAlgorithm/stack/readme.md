# STACKS
 * a linear data structure
 * stores data in LIFO(last in first out) manner
 * here, insertion and deletion takes place from the one same end
#### FUNCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH STACKS ARE:-
  ##### 1. EMPTY() :
                    Returns whether the stack is empty or not.
                    Time Complexity: O(1)
  ##### 2. SIZE() :
                    Returns whether the size of the stack.
                    Time Complexity: O(1) 
  ##### 3. TOP() :
                    Also called as peek()
                    Returns a reference to the topmost element of the stack.
                    Time Complexity: O(1)                    
  ##### 4. PUSH(element) :
                    Inserts the element at the top of the stack ,
                    Time Complexity: O(1) 
  ##### 5. POP() :                 
                    Deletes the topmost element of the stack.
                    Time Complexity: O(1)
